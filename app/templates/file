    Hide the sidebar by default on small screens.

    Add a "hamburger" button that's only visible on small screens to toggle the sidebar.

    Style the sidebar to appear as an overlay or slide in from the side when opened on mobile.

    Add a close button to the mobile sidebar and an overlay to close it by tapping outside.

    Adjust the main content area to accommodate these changes.



    Makes these key changes: 
        HTML Structure:
        The main layout is now a flex container <div class="flex h-screen">.

        Left Sidebar (<aside id="sidebar">):
            Changed classes to be fixed inset-y-0 left-0 z-40 ... transform -translate-x-full ... md:relative md:translate-x-0 .... This makes it fixed and off-screen on mobile, and part of the normal flow on medium screens and up.

            Added a close button (#sidebar-close-button) visible only on mobile.
            Added flex flex-col flex-shrink-0 for better internal layout and to prevent shrinking.
            The nav inside is now overflow-y-auto.

        Sidebar Overlay (#sidebar-overlay): A new div to cover the content when the mobile menu is open.
        Content Area Wrapper: A new div <div class="flex-1 flex flex-col overflow-hidden"> wraps the header, main content, and right sidebar.

        Header (<header>):
            Contains the mobile hamburger button (#mobile-menu-button), a mobile title, a desktop title/context.
            The theme toggle button (#theme-toggle-header) and desktop user info (#userDisplayNameHeader) are now here for better accessibility.

        Main Scrollable Content (<div class="flex-1 flex overflow-hidden">): Wraps your main tag and the right-sidebar, allowing them to share space and scroll independently if needed.
        Main Content (<main>): Is now flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-6.

        Right Sidebar:
            Theme toggle was removed (moved to header).
            User display ID is now #userDisplayNameRightSidebar.
            Added overflow-y-auto border-l dark:border-gray-700.

    JavaScript:

        Sidebar Toggle Logic:
            sidebar, mobileMenuButton, sidebarCloseButton, sidebarOverlay DOM elements are selected.
            openMobileMenu() and closeMobileMenu() functions to toggle sidebar visibility using transform classes and manage the overlay.

            Event listeners added to the hamburger button, close button, and overlay.
            Event listener added to navigation links within the sidebar to close it on mobile after a click.

        Theme Toggle:
            The theme-toggle button ID changed to theme-toggle-header. JS updated to reflect this.
            setInitialThemeIcon() function created to set the correct sun/moon icon on load and after toggling.

        User Info Display:
            updateUserInfoDisplay() now updates both #userDisplayNameHeader (in the main header) and #userDisplayNameRightSidebar (in the right sidebar).

        Body Scroll on Mobile Menu:
            openMobileMenu() adds overflow-hidden to document.body to prevent scrolling the page behind the mobile menu and md:overflow-auto to ensure desktop scroll behavior is maintained. closeMobileMenu() removes it.
